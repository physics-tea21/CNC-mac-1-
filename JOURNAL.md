## 11/4/2025 - An introduction...   

Good morning world, I spent the last few days working on something I wouldn't have guessed I would be working on a year ago. I am currently working on a CNC machine that should be able to connect to devices via bluetooth, cut anything from plastic, wood, aluminum and steels and cost a maximum of $400.00. 

I have just exited the research phase, although in all honesty even as I begin to design I will continue to research. 

This is what I have done so far: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1guQ0EIYpnIy_ylk_-7W_6XR--R1wjIKXg_Th8CZ3E4M/edit?tab=t.0![Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 7.33.50 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--24f414ecddc6c820f6eafb89ff7b31f57a7b7500/Screenshot%202025-11-04%20at%207.33.50%E2%80%AFAM.png)
   

## 11/5/2025 - Morning glory design.   

I woke up today and started working on my design- not because I initially wanted to, or felt motivated to work on this project first thing in the morning, but because I realize that consistency is key. For the past week (since I started this project), I have worked at least 30 minutes everyday. This morning I worked for ~1.5 hours, last night I worked on it for about an hour. ![Screenshot 2025-11-05 at 7.46.06 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODYzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--60c8f7be947e47b6ccdda7095d54f9714474733c/Screenshot%202025-11-05%20at%207.46.06%E2%80%AFAM.png)


By now, I have more or less finished the research stage, have finished basic design sketches and have a good feel for what I will be designing on Fusion360 tomorrow


Below is a progression of my design, sketches 5,6,7 are more or less the same. I have modeled this after the A1 FDM printer, but it has the same sort of rough outline as the Sainsmart 3020 Pro Ultra (a desktop CNC machine).

Please let me know if you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them!

## 11/4/2025 - An introduction...   

Good morning world, I spent the last few days working on something I wouldn't have guessed I would be working on a year ago. I am currently working on a CNC machine that should be able to connect to devices via bluetooth, cut anything from plastic, wood, aluminum and steels and cost a maximum of $400.00. 

I have just exited the research phase, although in all honesty even as I begin to design I will continue to research. 

This is what I have done so far: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1guQ0EIYpnIy_ylk_-7W_6XR--R1wjIKXg_Th8CZ3E4M/edit?tab=t.0![Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 7.33.50 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--24f414ecddc6c820f6eafb89ff7b31f57a7b7500/Screenshot%202025-11-04%20at%207.33.50%E2%80%AFAM.png)
